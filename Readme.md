*Refer to the research paper given in the API to know more about the methods and results of the same.*

#### Hosting Method

Copy the following commands into your terminal point at your project directory.

*Here in requirements.txt you may need to remove tensorflow_intel package if using in linux*

```python
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dhruvacube/OsteoArithirites.git
